# Kickstart-My-Chart

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project aims to understand what characteristics allow a project to achieve its intended crowdfund goal on Kickstarter. I will complete this objective via rigorous analysis and visualization of past Kickstarter project data on Excel. The derived insights that will enable more projects to succeed on Kickstarter in future.  


### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Pivot Table
* Excel Graph
* Conditional Formating

### Technologies
* Excel

## Project Description
After cleaning and reorganizing data into a more usable form via column splitting and other methods, I utilize conditional formatting to indicate each project's outcome visually. The pivot table is then employed to analyze the transformed data based on a chosen variable, while crucial patterns are uncovered after visualization by Excel graphs. Finally, a document is drafted to summarize all findings and their implications.
